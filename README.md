# wEBX
An ebx (Enhanced Binary XML) file viewer that runs in your browser.

Tested with fb games from fb2(bf3) to fb2014(swbf1, bf1, bfv)

You need a special converter for ebx files that converts them to json. Will probably be released here later on.

### **Possible** plans:
- Cleanup 
- Transfer nodes for the graph
- Maybe export as dbx?
- Viewers for diffrent kinds of logic (timeline, ui graphs, etc.)
- Blueprint creation? (for vext/mapeditor)
